# Executive Summary: CMS Migration Strategy

**Project:** Clínica Ferreira Borges Website - Full CMS Migration
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** Proposal

---

## Overview

Transform the Clínica Ferreira Borges website from 60% CMS-driven to **95%+ fully CMS-driven**, empowering the marketing team to manage all website content without developer intervention.

---

## Current Situation

### Content Distribution Today

| Source | Percentage | What's There | Problem |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Database** | 60% | Treatments, team, pricing, payments | ✅ Working well |
| **Translation Files** | 30% | Page content, labels, descriptions | ⚠️ Requires developer to update |
| **Hardcoded** | 10% | Contact info, URLs, legal text | ⚠️ Scattered across 15+ files |

### Key Pain Points

1. **Marketing can't update content** - Need developer for every text change
2. **Contact info scattered** - Phone number hardcoded in 10+ files
3. **No page creation** - Can't launch new pages without code
4. **Legal content locked** - Terms & conditions hardcoded
5. **Inconsistent CTAs** - Booking URL repeated everywhere

---

## Proposed Solution

### Generic Page Builder System

Create a **flexible, section-based CMS** that allows:

```
Page = {
  Template (home, info, legal, contact)
  + Sections (hero, features, CTA, FAQ, etc.)
  + Multilingual Content (PT/EN)
  + SEO Metadata
}
```

**15+ Pre-built Section Types:**
- Hero banners
- Feature grids
- Call-to-actions
- FAQs
- Team grids
- Pricing tables
- Contact forms
- Testimonials
- And more...

### What Changes

**Before:**
```
Want to update hero text?
→ Edit translation file
→ Developer review
→ Git commit
→ Deploy
```

**After:**
```
Want to update hero text?
→ Open admin panel
→ Edit text
→ Click save
→ Live immediately
```
