# Admin Login Redirect Loop - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The admin login page at `/admin/login` was stuck in an infinite redirect loop, continuously reloading the page.

## Root Cause
The admin layout (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx`) was running authentication checks for ALL admin routes, including the login page itself. This created a loop:
1. User visits `/admin/login`
2. Layout checks authentication
3. User not authenticated → redirect to `/admin/login`
4. Loop repeats infinitely

## Solution
Implemented Next.js route groups to separate protected and public admin routes:

### Changes Made

1. **Simplified Admin Layout** (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx`)
   - Removed authentication logic
   - Now serves as a simple wrapper for all admin routes

2. **Created Protected Route Group** (`src/app/admin/(protected)/layout.tsx`)
   - New layout that handles authentication
   - Only applies to dashboard and CRUD pages
   - Includes the admin header and navigation

3. **Moved Protected Pages**
   - Moved dashboard: `page.tsx` → `(protected)/page.tsx`
   - Moved CRUD pages:
     - `treatments/` → `(protected)/treatments/`
     - `team/` → `(protected)/team/`
     - `faqs/` → `(protected)/faqs/`
     - `submissions/` → `(protected)/submissions/`
     - `settings/` → `(protected)/settings/`

4. **Login Page** (`src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`)
   - Remains outside the protected group
   - No authentication required to access it

## Route Structure

```
src/app/admin/
├── layout.tsx              # No auth check - wraps all admin routes
├── login/                  # Public - no auth required
│   └── page.tsx
└── (protected)/            # Protected group
    ├── layout.tsx          # Auth check + admin header/nav
    ├── page.tsx            # Dashboard
    ├── treatments/         # CRUD pages
    ├── team/
    ├── faqs/
    ├── submissions/
    └── settings/
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User visits `/admin/login`**
   - Admin layout wraps it (no auth check)
   - Login page renders normally
   - No redirect loop ✅

2. **User visits `/admin` (dashboard)**
   - Admin layout wraps it
   - Protected layout checks auth
   - If not authenticated → redirect to `/admin/login`
   - If authenticated → show dashboard with header/nav ✅

3. **User logs in successfully**
   - Redirect to `/admin`
   - Protected layout sees authenticated user
   - Shows dashboard ✅

## Testing

✅ **Before Fix:**
```
GET /admin/login 200 in 33ms
GET /admin/login 200 in 38ms
GET /admin/login 200 in 40ms
GET /admin/login 200 in 41ms
... (infinite loop)
```

✅ **After Fix:**
```
GET /admin/login 200 in 92ms
(single request, page loads successfully)
```

## Access Information

**Admin Login:** http://localhost:3001/admin/login
**Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@clinicaferreiraborges.pt`
- Password: `Admin123!`

## Status: FIXED ✅

The login page now works correctly without any redirect loops!
