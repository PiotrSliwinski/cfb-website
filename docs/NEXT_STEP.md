## üîç One Thing Left: Get Your Correct Place ID

The current Place ID in `.env.local` is a placeholder. You need to find the correct one for your clinic.

### Quick Method (1 minute):

1. **Go to Google's Place ID Finder:**
   üëâ https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-placeid-finder

2. **Search for your clinic:**
   - Type: `Clinica Ferreira Borges, Lisboa`
   - Or: `Rua Ferreira Borges 173C, 1350-130 Lisboa`

3. **Click on your business marker** on the map

4. **Copy the Place ID** that appears (starts with "ChIJ...")

5. **Update `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=ChIJYourActualPlaceIdHere
   ```

6. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop current server, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your website:**
   üëâ http://localhost:3000

8. **Scroll to testimonials** - you should see your 5-star Google reviews! üåü

## Alternative: Test with a Known Place

To verify everything works, you can temporarily test with a known Place ID:

```bash
# Famous Portuguese location for testing
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=ChIJQQ2CwuFkJA0RUdkM5HFBMmk
```

This will show reviews for Pal√°cio da Bolsa in Porto (just for testing).

## What Happens Next

Once you add the correct Place ID:
- Your 5-star Google reviews will automatically appear on the homepage
- Reviews update every hour
- New reviews automatically show up
- Works in both Portuguese and English
- Mobile responsive design

## Current Status

**Your website is live at:** http://localhost:3000

**What you'll see now:** A "Configuration Required" message (because the Place ID needs updating)

**After updating Place ID:** Real 5-star Google reviews from your clinic! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
