## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 (Supabase)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Storage, Row Level Security)

   - Fix needed: Update all `t(key, fallback)` to `t(key) || fallback`
   - Status: Partially fixed, ~5-10 instances remaining

2. **Admin Panel Incomplete**
   - Treatment editor not built (create/edit forms)
   - Team editor not built
   - Settings pages not built
   - Media uploader not built
   - Form validation not implemented

3. **Missing Features**
   - Rich text editor not integrated

## 💡 Helpful Commands

```bash
# Start everything
npx supabase start
npm run dev

# Access points
open http://localhost:3000/admin            # Admin panel
open http://127.0.0.1:54323                 # Supabase Studio

# Database
npx supabase status                         # Check status
npx supabase db reset                       # Reset & re-run migrations
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres"  # Direct DB access

# Stop
npx supabase stop
```

## 📝 Key Learnings

1. **Supabase Setup**
   - First-time Docker pull takes 5-10 minutes
   - Migrations apply cleanly on fresh database
   - RLS policies working as expected

2. **Admin Panel Architecture**
   - Server Components for data fetching (no loading states needed)
   - Client Components only for forms/interactivity
   - Supabase Auth integrates seamlessly with Next.js

3. **TypeScript Challenges**
   - next-intl `t()` function signature changed
   - Need to use `t(key) || fallback` pattern
   - Build-time errors don't always prevent runtime success

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

1. **Custom Admin vs Third-Party CMS**
   - Chose custom for full control
   - Tailwind CSS for consistency with main site
   - Server-side rendering for performance

2. **Database Schema**
   - Separate translation tables (not JSONB columns)
   - RLS for security
   - UUID primary keys

3. **Authentication**
   - Supabase Auth (simple, integrated)
   - Email/password only (can add OAuth later)
   - Protected routes via middleware

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation files are ready for reference:
- **[TRANSITION-PLAN.md](TRANSITION-PLAN.md)** - Complete roadmap
- **[ADMIN_GUIDE.md](docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md)** - End-user documentation
- **[PROGRESS-UPDATE.md](PROGRESS-UPDATE.md)** - Detailed today's work
- **[README-TRANSITION.md](README-TRANSITION.md)** - Quick start guide

---

## 🙏 Ready to Continue

The foundation is solid. Database is populated, admin panel structure is in place, and authentication works. The next major task is building the CRUD forms for treatments and team members, which will complete the core admin functionality.

**Estimated time to completion**: 2-3 more days of focused work.
